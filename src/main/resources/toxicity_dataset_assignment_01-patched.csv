"yeah that sucked, fixed
 
 Done.",1
LOL you called my decorator stupid...=),1
"This line is super horrible and needs to die! Please do something like:
  
  attempts = 1
  if retries >= 1:
  attempts = retries + 1
 
 or something along those lines.
 
 also - a test would be nice (there are already tests that test some cases of this so just add another one in test_compute_mgr.py",1
Might be cleaner to write an OCP that wraps this and prunes out the downloads... I know that's a lot more code/sucks but that's probably the cleanest way?  Can you just put this in the factory?  Or put it at each client?,1
"ooh, burn!",1
"Yes, and ... crap.",1
stupid style nit - list comprehension is slightly nicer.,1

Damn! Thought I'd gotten rid of it everywhere. New patch incoming,1
"damn, and I thought I had gotten it right :P",1
"Oh, yes, it was inconsistent already. I just copy pasted the previous code. Silly me.",1
"Basically:
 
 if self.microversion and 'X-OpenStack-Nova-API-Version' in headers and headers['X-OpenStack-Nova-API-Version'] != self.microversion:

 And:
 
 if not self.microversion and 'X-OpenStack-Nova-API-Version' in headers:
  self.fail('oh you dirty bastard')",1
"I think this solution is braindead also, like the previous one. Can we try to ass the null.? Anyway, +2 because safe.",1
Damn!,1
"The caching is only necessary for the performance benefit of not needing to do that service query from the DB every time we get an instance, which doubles the traffic to the DB on every instance query, which kind of sucks.
 
 Agree with leaving the caching in, that was my point with removing the TODO so we don't forget about this.",1
"damnit, I hate it when I forget to save the file before I commit ;-)

yes they were notes as I was coding the C file

Done.",1
Damn. I thought I'd removed those. Sorry.,1
"Ah yes, I remember this damm mess now. Unfortunately some of the task code needs a conductor. Seems silly to do that over rpc just for dependency reasons.",1
"Is this still used anywhere?
 
 (later)
 
 Looks like still used in nova.tests.unit.test_service, so I guess we can't remove it. Damn.",1
"you can. some people prefer reinterpret_cast because it shouts ""danger! crappy type-unsafe C API here!"". others prefer static_cast because it's the weakest cast that will still work. i'll +2 either (but tend to use reinterpret_cast personally; i've never seen anyone make the mistakes that static_cast would prevent in this specific circumstance).",1
remove the tabs please - spaces only - the change makes this review a bitch to read and doesn't match the existing formatting.,1
"Damn, forgot to delete this after the code changed during review... well, better to leave it here than to get inconsistent with ToT now I guess.",1
Damn! Thought I caught all those! Thanks.,1
"rather than creating this useless structure, just pass the size in the kmem_cache_create in the _probe function ?

but yeh that's not important, a dirty patch should be dirty....",1
Crap. Sorry about that. Done.,1
Damn grammar :-P,1
How the heck did that get in there? Done....,1
"might want to inject a pause here prior to the reboot; depends on how fast it cycles (getting a ""go do this"" message when the window is 1s sucks)",1
This'll crap out if the search fails,1
"It doesn't relate to your patch, but please, remove this dots. It sucks and unreadable! Also, If this module will be moved in future, everything will break.
 I prefer to use this simple code:

"Agree with Alexander, here is where separate validators suck - you may easily not notice the same work is done twice.",1
"Does this mean that if the header is corrupt, we're screwed?",1
"The optimizer should usually be able to make this not suck, but thread.name.assign() is more direct.",1
"hmmmm...that is a good reason to keep mountpoint around. Which kind of sucks. Also, mountpoint is optional from Nova's standpoint, so we probably shouldn't just raise and fail, unless it's a multi-attach to the same instance (the knucklehead case), which means more checks for that case.
 I vote we just dis-allow that...",1
"Wtf why did you change "" to ' when we are changing everywhere ' to """,1
"I think it would be nice if we have more than one choice there, like
 
 if [[ ""$users_agree"" == ""y"" ]] || [[ ""$users_agree"" == ""Y"" ]] || [[ ""$users_agree"" == ""yes"" ]];
 
 I personally hate this situations when I press 'y' and application tell me 'wrong choice, man, bye-bye. In next time you should write full ""yes"", you moron'.",1
actually C enums don't really check IIRC and never have. You can assign a bogus value. They're not that useful. I'm happy to get rid of this crap however.,1
"No, indent(1) is dumb. Fixed.",1
Are we not going to assume error 401 or anything (that I got bitched about with the amphora API proposal still in the review pipeline)?,1
"darn. you right. :)
 
 peer programming works! or sileht programming works.",1
"Ok, fair enough.
 
 Just seems like it could be used outside openstack (and if later we have to rename it so that it's more obvious it can be used outside, that sorta sucks to have to go through that process).",1
I got rid of all the LDAP specific nonsense,1
"you're right, it looked clumsy when I did it the other way but I think it's the right way. I'll fix it.",1
"I disagree. In this instance it is an instance that we have partially created, and that the user has no knowledge of its existence. We should not leave half created turds lying around. However, you have drawn attention to that fact that we are eating an exception, which we should not be doing.",1
damn.. I missed that one. Thanks,1
"Oh, yeah, what a crap.  Maybe use this cleanup commit to finally get rid of that odd --language handling for good.",1
"Yes, but I guess this is rabbit issue only, due to the fact that the reply queue have been historically created with auto_delete=True.
 
 Another rabbitmq reported issue in the past was that a HA rabbitmq cluster that failover can in certain circumstance report that the queue doesn't exists just after the failover when It exists in reality. That another reason of why we do this crap.",1
"I don't agree here, property in python are awful, especially when you want to test such methods.",1
"The CBManagerState change in the new SDK is so sucky :-( We did https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/587510/5/device/bluetooth/bluetooth_adapter_mac.mm#43 on Mac (and see discussion on bug linked from that CL). But if this is the only place, this is fine too.",1
bouh bouh shame,1
"Damn, someday I'll learn how to spell, lol.",1
shit :(,1
You are an evil :O!,1
Damn abbreviations :-P,1
"honestly, i might even change it to 60min.  timeouts are supposed to catch the ""this is totally screwed up, let's abort"" not ""we're close to normal, but let's throw up everywhere anyways"".",1
"Is this still used anywhere?
 
 (later)
 
 Looks like still used in nova.tests.unit.test_service, so I guess we can't remove it. Damn.",1
"ah, thats nice, encoding stuff already crap",1
WTF,1
"Oh, shit, you're right. Is there a less error-prone way to do this than scattering calls to ClearReportsPending throughout the function?",1
Forget to say. Maybe you have seen suck behaviour in real-life? Could you please provide an example?,1
Totally clumsy! I dislike it immensely! I think we should make a fileglobbing feature.,1
I shouldn't need to load an L3 agent to test the DB logic behavior! That's nonsense.,1
Forgot about this. I'm having a hell of a time getting libcros to find <glib-object.h>. Working on that now.,1

this is the only new bit. stupid git.,1
"Normally I'm anal about avoiding duplication, but there is subtle enough differences between each that it's not really worth it; same goes for the prefix bit imo.",1
Ah damn I misread the bug -_-,1
"Crap, I thought I had that in there.",1
"I'll be damned. I just assumed that weak_ptr needs a full definition of ServiceProxy to generate the default destructor of WeaveClient.

"Yea, it is a bit messy - and particularly when considering arm32-style paired single registers.  I think a portable sameness test would be something like:

I would have kept the comments out of the localrc generated but I am anally retentive.,1
"because bash sucks (and I suck at writing bash also), it doesn't like the empty array when you run with -u.",1
Damn grammar :-P,1
I really hate the 'i' as it smells like hungarian notation. I'd like something more self documenting. How about nocase? __startswith_nocase=Y,1
"I know this is incredibly anal, but to you want to make this an atomic operation? I think this is going to be atomic no matter what, but maybe it should be explicit so there is no chance that someone will be able to get a half set value.",1
"Crap, this is an artifact of a previous revision. It's simply the last time a change was made to Tuskar's cloud.",1
"Yes, doc strings in unit tests suck because they cause the name of the failing test to be hidden.",1
"Yes, unfortunately this does add some fragility here. Though you are wrong that it is inserting namespace data. And of course if the compiler does add that, it would make for a 100% failure rate of the test (fun fact: __func__ apparently at least on the Android build system is resolved to __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ which does add a lot of crap).

As per the commend on the hardcoded strings though, this way we are ensuring we have to correct mapping and don't require constants for everything that is redundant and makes it harder to add tests.

Again, this is a test - not another abstraction layer on top of a HAL on top of an API...",1

  <mordred> hell, I think run_tests.sh is an abomination anyway - I can't imagine having it call out to a project-specific thing will be any worse if it gets us a bulk of things to be oslo

"If someone stupidly configures retry_attempts to be 0, then this won't execute at all. Logging an error is probably warranted. We might also consider treating invalid values as being ""1""... just because somebody is bound to misconfigure and go scratching their heads when things go sideways.",1
exact same thing as a dumb mmap,1
"One way to make exploitation harder even if there's no guard page would be to add weak secondary stack ASLR in Bionic. The problem with that is it can screw over callers with very precisely sized stacks, as they'll have less available than they expect.

Using a single page for ASLR with stacks >= 1M is arguably sane because they could be screwed over by a compiler update if they're that close to the end...

I have a patch doing this but it's pretty sketchy so I didn't have plans to upstream it.",1
"Oh I dislike this line, it's abosolutelly unclear what the hell you are doing here=).",1
Can we reduce this down to 1 sec or so? 5 seems awful large!,1
"This part is apparently not true. (if by upper layers, you mean other parts of flashrom.)

I tried 'flashrom --read /tmp/c.bin' on Kevin, and this produced a large (full 8MB I think?) read, which apparently the SPI driver still can't handle. I need to fix that up...

But this means unfortunately, we should keep the hack for now, and loop over eraseblock sized chunks in the 'read' path still. And for your sake, we can do the same for writes. (I just objected to changing the ""page size"".)

Sorry for jerking you around a bit :) I'll try to fix things up on the MTD side a bit, so we don't have to live with these hacks forever.",1
